# FizzBuzz_Project
# Current version: 0.0.3

FizzBuzz is a programming challenge sometimes used in job interviews. The candidate is required to write a program that prints every number from 1 to 100. 
For each number that is a multiple of 3, the program should replace the number with the word Fizz; for each number that is a multiple of 5, replace it with 
the word buzz. The difficulty of this programming challenge comes in the follow-up questions. A candidate may be required to replace or even add two or three 
additional words or change which numbers get replaced. If their attempt is not efficient, their code could get very messy very quickly. The purpose of the 
challenge is to test the candidate's foresight and the general adaptability of their code. The goal of this program is to serve as the ultimate answer to all 
of these follow-up questions. Instead of updating or refactoring the code to satisfy any follow-up questions, this program offers a straightforward user interface 
that allows the user to modify the simple game of FizzBuzz in any way they see fit, without ever needing to touch the code.
