FizzBuzz is a programming challenge sometimes used in job interviews. 
The candidate is required to write a program that prints every number 
from 1 to 100. For each number that is a multiple of 3, the program
should replace the number with the word Fizz; for each number that is 
a multiple of 5, replace it with the word buzz.

A candidate may be required to replace or add two or three additional 
words or change which numbers get replaced. If their attempt is not 
efficient, their code could get very messy very quickly. The purpose
of the challenge is to test the candidate's foresight and the general 
adaptability of their code.

The goal of this program is to answer these follow-up questions without 
updating or refactoring the code. The program offers a straightforward 
interface that allows the user to modify the simple game of FizzBuzz
in any way they see fit, without ever needing to touch the code.
